<h1>Securing the Cloud: Penetration Testing in Cloud Environments</h1>

<p>As organizations migrate to cloud platforms, ensuring the security of cloud infrastructure and services becomes paramount. Penetration testing in cloud environments helps identify misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, and gaps that could be exploited by attackers.</p>

<h2>Key Takeaways:</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Shared Responsibility Model:</strong> Understanding the division of security duties between cloud providers and customers is essential for effective testing.</li>
    <li><strong>Misconfiguration Risks:</strong> Common issues include open storage buckets, overly permissive IAM policies, and exposed management consoles.</li>
    <li><strong>API Security:</strong> Testing APIs for authentication weaknesses, injection flaws, and improper data exposure.</li>
    <li><strong>Container and Serverless Security:</strong> Assessing vulnerabilities in container orchestration and serverless functions running in the cloud.</li>
</ul>

<p>Penetration testers must tailor their approaches to cloud-specific architectures and tools, often leveraging cloud-native services alongside traditional testing techniques.</p>
