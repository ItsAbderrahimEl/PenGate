<h1>Beyond the Breach: Mastering Post-Exploitation in Pentesting</h1>

<p>Post-exploitation is where the real power of a compromise unfolds. After gaining access to a system, penetration testers dive deeper to explore the network, extract sensitive data, and understand the full scope of the breach. This phase simulates what a real attacker would do after breaking in — making it one of the most valuable parts of an engagement.</p>

<h2>Key Takeaways:</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Privilege Escalation:</strong> Gaining root or SYSTEM privileges is a primary goal. Techniques include exploiting kernel vulnerabilities, misconfigured SUDO rules, or abusing weak permissions on critical files.</li>

    <li><strong>Credential Dumping:</strong> Extracting stored credentials using tools like <code>mimikatz</code>, <code>lsass</code> memory dumps, or grabbing saved passwords from browsers can help pivot or maintain access.</li>

    <li><strong>Lateral Movement:</strong> Once inside, attackers move through the network via tools like RDP, SMB, or exploiting trust relationships. Enumerating the internal environment is key here.</li>

    <li><strong>Persistence:</strong> Techniques like scheduled tasks, registry edits, or planting backdoors ensure access is retained even after reboots or reconfigurations.</li>
</ul>

<p>Post-exploitation is all about stealth, patience, and precision. The objective isn’t just to cause damage — it’s to understand what an attacker could achieve and provide detailed remediation strategies to your clients or organization.</p>

<p>For blue teams, understanding post-exploitation techniques is vital for building robust detection and response strategies. It’s not just about preventing access — it's about spotting malicious activity after it’s already begun.</p>
