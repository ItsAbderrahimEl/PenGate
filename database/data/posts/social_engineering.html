<h1>The Human Exploit: Social Engineering in Penetration Testing</h1>

<p>While firewalls and antivirus software may guard systems, the human element remains one of the weakest links in cybersecurity. <em>Social engineering</em> is the art of manipulating people into revealing confidential information or performing actions that compromise security — and it's a powerful technique in a penetration tester's toolkit.</p>

<h2>Key Takeaways:</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Phishing:</strong> One of the most common techniques. Attackers send emails mimicking trusted sources to trick users into clicking malicious links or submitting credentials on fake login pages.</li>

    <li><strong>Pretexting:</strong> This involves crafting a believable scenario or identity (like pretending to be IT support) to gain trust and extract sensitive information or access.</li>

    <li><strong>USB Drops:</strong> Dropping malicious USB drives in strategic locations relies on curiosity or habit. Once plugged in, the drive can automatically execute a payload or open a backdoor.</li>

    <li><strong>Tailgating:</strong> In physical assessments, attackers follow authorized personnel into secure areas without proper clearance — exploiting politeness or busy environments.</li>
</ul>

<p>Social engineering attacks often bypass even the most secure technical controls. In red team operations, these tactics test not just systems, but the awareness and readiness of employees to handle suspicious interactions.</p>

<p>To defend against such attacks, organizations must invest in regular security awareness training, phishing simulations, and clearly defined protocols for verifying identity and access requests.</p>
