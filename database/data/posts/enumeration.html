<h1>Mapping the Terrain: Network Scanning and Enumeration in Penetration Testing</h1>

<p>Network scanning and enumeration are foundational steps in penetration testing that help uncover active devices, open ports, services, and potential vulnerabilities within a target network.</p>

<h2>Key Takeaways:</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Scanning:</strong> Techniques like ping sweeps and port scanning identify live hosts and the services they expose.</li>
    <li><strong>Enumeration:</strong> Gathering detailed information about network resources, such as usernames, shares, and system configurations.</li>
    <li><strong>Common Tools:</strong> Nmap, Netcat, and Nessus are widely used to automate scanning and enumeration processes.</li>
    <li><strong>Importance:</strong> Accurate mapping enables penetration testers to plan targeted attacks and identify weak points effectively.</li>
</ul>
