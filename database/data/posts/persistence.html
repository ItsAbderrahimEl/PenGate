<h1>Staying Hidden: Persistence Techniques in Penetration Testing</h1>

<p>In penetration testing and red teaming, <em>persistence</em> refers to the ability to maintain access to a compromised system even after reboots or detection attempts. Once access is gained, a smart attacker ensures they won’t need to break in again — this is where persistence techniques come into play.</p>

<h2>Key Takeaways:</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Startup & Scheduled Tasks:</strong> Creating scheduled tasks or modifying startup folders/registry keys ensures payloads or shells are re-executed upon system boot or user login.</li>

    <li><strong>Abusing Legitimate Tools:</strong> Using trusted tools like <code>certutil</code>, <code>PowerShell</code>, or WMI to maintain stealthy backdoors minimizes the risk of detection from AV or EDR.</li>

    <li><strong>DLL Hijacking & Services:</strong> By planting malicious DLLs or modifying Windows services, attackers can keep access even after a system reboot, especially on high-value servers or domain controllers.</li>

    <li><strong>Backdooring Accounts:</strong> Creating hidden users or adding SSH keys to authorized files allows persistent access without needing to exploit vulnerabilities again.</li>
</ul>

<p>Persistence is often subtle and difficult to detect. It's designed not to trigger alarms — which is why it’s so dangerous. Ethical hackers test these techniques to reveal how long an attacker could remain in a system undetected.</p>

<p>For defenders, identifying and neutralizing persistence mechanisms is a key component of incident response and digital forensics. Tools like Sysinternals, Autoruns, and EDR platforms can help uncover stealthy implants.</p>
