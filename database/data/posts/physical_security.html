<h1>Breaking Barriers: Physical Security in Penetration Testing</h1>

<p>While digital defenses are crucial, physical security often represents the weakest link in an organization's protection. Penetration testers assess physical security controls to identify risks that could allow unauthorized access to sensitive areas and systems.</p>

<h2>Key Takeaways:</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Access Controls:</strong> Evaluating locks, badges, biometric systems, and security guards to test their effectiveness against bypass techniques.</li>
    <li><strong>Tailgating and Piggybacking:</strong> Testing whether unauthorized individuals can follow authorized personnel into restricted areas.</li>
    <li><strong>Device Security:</strong> Checking for unattended or unsecured hardware such as workstations, servers, and network devices.</li>
    <li><strong>Social Engineering in Person:</strong> Using impersonation and pretexting to gain physical access or sensitive information.</li>
</ul>
