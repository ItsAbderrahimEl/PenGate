<h1>Invisible Frontiers: Wireless Attacks in Penetration Testing</h1>

<p>Wireless networks offer convenience but also present unique security challenges. <em>Wireless attacks</em> target vulnerabilities in Wi-Fi protocols, misconfigurations, and weak authentication to intercept, disrupt, or infiltrate networks.</p>

<h2>Key Takeaways:</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Packet Sniffing:</strong> Capturing unencrypted wireless traffic to gather sensitive data or credentials.</li>

    <li><strong>Rogue Access Points:</strong> Setting up fake Wi-Fi hotspots to trick users into connecting, enabling man-in-the-middle attacks.</li>

    <li><strong>WEP/WPA Cracking:</strong> Exploiting weak encryption protocols like WEP or poorly configured WPA to gain unauthorized access.</li>

    <li><strong>Deauthentication Attacks:</strong> Forcing devices off a network to capture handshake data or disrupt communications.</li>
</ul>

<p>Effective wireless security requires strong encryption (WPA3), regular monitoring for rogue devices, and user awareness to prevent connecting to untrusted networks.</p>
