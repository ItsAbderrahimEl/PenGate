<h1>Cracking the Code: Web Application Vulnerabilities in Pentesting</h1>

<p>Web applications are often the most exposed assets of any organization, making them a frequent target for attackers. In penetration testing, identifying and exploiting web vulnerabilities is a critical skill that simulates real-world threats and helps companies secure their digital infrastructure.</p>

<h2>Key Takeaways:</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>SQL Injection (SQLi):</strong> A classic yet still-prevalent attack where malicious SQL statements are inserted into input fields. If successful, it can allow data exfiltration, privilege escalation, or even full database control.</li>

    <li><strong>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):</strong> XSS allows attackers to inject malicious JavaScript into web pages viewed by other users. This can lead to session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.</li>

    <li><strong>Authentication Bypass:</strong> Weak login mechanisms, lack of rate limiting, and logic flaws can allow attackers to bypass login screens entirely. Techniques include brute force, session fixation, or manipulating JWTs.</li>

    <li><strong>File Upload Vulnerabilities:</strong> Improperly secured file upload features can allow attackers to upload web shells or executable scripts, providing remote code execution or access to sensitive data.</li>
</ul>

<p>Tools like <code>Burp Suite</code>, <code>OWASP ZAP</code>, and <code>sqlmap</code> are essential in automating detection and exploitation of these vulnerabilities. But automation alone isn’t enough — manual testing reveals logic flaws and edge cases that tools can miss.</p>

<p>Whether you're attacking or defending, knowing these common weaknesses is vital. The more you understand the attack surface, the better you can defend it.</p>
