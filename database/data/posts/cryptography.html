<h1>Cracking the Code: Cryptography in Penetration Testing</h1>

<p>Cryptography is the cornerstone of data security, protecting information through encryption, hashing, and digital signatures. Penetration testers evaluate the strength and implementation of cryptographic systems to uncover weaknesses that could lead to data breaches.</p>

<h2>Key Takeaways:</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Encryption Weaknesses:</strong> Identifying the use of outdated algorithms like MD5 or SHA-1, and weak key management practices.</li>
    <li><strong>Implementation Flaws:</strong> Poorly implemented cryptographic protocols can introduce vulnerabilities such as padding oracle attacks or side-channel leaks.</li>
    <li><strong>Certificate Issues:</strong> Testing for expired, self-signed, or misconfigured SSL/TLS certificates that undermine secure communications.</li>
    <li><strong>Cryptanalysis Techniques:</strong> Using brute force, rainbow tables, and other methods to break or bypass encryption.</li>
</ul>

<p>Penetration testers must understand cryptographic principles to assess whether sensitive data remains secure under attack and to advise on best practices.</p>
