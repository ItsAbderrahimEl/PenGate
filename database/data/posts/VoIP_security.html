<h1>Securing Voices: Penetration Testing VoIP Systems</h1>

<p>Voice over IP (VoIP) technology revolutionizes communication but also introduces unique security challenges. Penetration testing VoIP systems uncovers vulnerabilities that could lead to eavesdropping, toll fraud, and service disruption.</p>

<h2>Key Takeaways:</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Eavesdropping:</strong> Intercepting unencrypted VoIP traffic to capture sensitive conversations.</li>
    <li><strong>Toll Fraud:</strong> Exploiting system weaknesses to make unauthorized calls at the organization’s expense.</li>
    <li><strong>Denial of Service (DoS):</strong> Flooding VoIP servers to disrupt voice services and communications.</li>
    <li><strong>VoIP Protocol Vulnerabilities:</strong> Attacks on protocols like SIP and RTP that facilitate call setup and media transmission.</li>
</ul>
