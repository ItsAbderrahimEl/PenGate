<h1>Gathering the Puzzle Pieces: OSINT in Penetration Testing</h1>

<p>Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) is the practice of collecting publicly available information to build a comprehensive profile of a target. In penetration testing, OSINT helps identify potential vulnerabilities and attack vectors before direct exploitation begins.</p>

<h2>Key Takeaways:</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Data Sources:</strong> OSINT leverages social media, public databases, company websites, WHOIS records, leaked credentials, and more to gather valuable insights.</li>
    <li><strong>Passive Reconnaissance:</strong> OSINT is a stealthy method that does not interact directly with the target systems, minimizing detection risk.</li>
    <li><strong>Tools and Techniques:</strong> Tools like Maltego, Shodan, theHarvester, and Google Dorking automate and enhance data gathering.</li>
    <li><strong>Application:</strong> Information from OSINT guides subsequent penetration testing phases, such as phishing campaigns, network mapping, and social engineering.</li>
</ul>
